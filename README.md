This a project for computer vision course

This project aimed to recognize the facial expression captured from the front camera. It used a set of single static image with different expression labels as the training database, projected the training image to subspaces. And then it calculated out the similar face of the tested expression in the training database, and gave out the label of that face as the recognition result of captured face.

The result demonstrated several shortages of this eigenface method in face expression recognition. Due to it depended on the gray level similarity of the training image set and the given test image, it would be influenced greatly while the light, angle, face size and face color were changed in either training database or the captured test image.
